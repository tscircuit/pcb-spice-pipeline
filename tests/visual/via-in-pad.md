# Via-in-pad ground reproduction

Run `node --import tsx tests/visual/via-in-pad.ts` to regenerate the two views from `tests/fixtures/via-in-pad.tsx`. Open [top](via-in-pad-top.svg) and [inner1](via-in-pad-inner1.svg) together. On top, each ground pad below a signal pad contains a centered via (0.30 mm copper diameter inside the 0.40 mm pad). On inner1, the same two vias meet a solid GND pour. The plated barrels span top to inner1; there are no ground lead traces. The fixture is a reduced native TSX version of the DDR channel.

Run `node --import tsx --test tests/via-in-pad.test.ts`: the regression requires two vertical reference paths, one for each ground pin. The extractor accepts circular or rectangular pads when the via annulus fits inside the pad and its plated barrel is fully inside the plane polygon. Partial overlaps require a more detailed contact model and are rejected.
