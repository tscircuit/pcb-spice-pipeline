# @tscircuit/pcb-spice-pipeline

Circuit JSON in, structured signal-integrity results out. The root entry is a deterministic library: it never reads files, downloads models, discovers tools, runs processes, inspects the environment, or writes reports. All solver execution is supplied explicitly by the caller.

```ts
import { runPipeline, generateReport } from '@tscircuit/pcb-spice-pipeline'
import type { RunSolver } from '@tscircuit/pcb-spice-pipeline'

const runSolver: RunSolver = async request => {
  // Execute the requested solver locally, in a worker, or through your service.
  // Reject on an unsuccessful exit and return the exact output text.
  return yourSolverService(request)
}

const result = await runPipeline({
  circuitJson,
  modeling,
  ibisSources: { 'models/driver.ibs': driverIbisBytes },
  runSolver,
  onProgress: message => showProgress(message),
})
const reportFiles = generateReport(result) // { 'results.html': '...', 'csv/...': '...' }
```

`ibisSources` is `Record<string, Uint8Array | string>`, keyed by each `ibis_model_asset.project_relative_path`. Callers prepare models and extract archives before calling the library. Asset URLs are metadata and never trigger downloads. Strings are encoded as UTF-8; byte inputs preserve BOM and CRLF. Optional `modeling.ibisModelAssetSha256` must contain an expected SHA-256 for every used asset when supplied.

The solver callback receives:

```ts
type SolverRequest = {
  solver: 'fasthenry' | 'fastercap' | 'ngspice'
  files: Record<string, string> // relative filenames and complete input contents
  args: string[]
  outputFiles: string[]        // requested output filenames
}
type SolverResult = {
  stdout: string
  stderr: string
  files: Record<string, string>
  exitCode?: number // omit when the callback rejects unsuccessful exits
}
```

Each request has an independent working directory. FastHenry gets coarse and refined extraction requests; FasterCap gets its automatic-refinement request; each experiment gets one ngspice transient shared by all its probes and eyes. The callback must reject unsuccessful process exits or return their nonzero `exitCode`. The library additionally checks stdout/stderr diagnostics, required outputs, conductor ordering, finite matrices, reciprocity, passivity, mesh convergence, analytic DC resistance, capacitance scaling and finite-return energy/charge reconstruction. Transients must contain finite, increasing timestamps and cover the declared recording. Recovered ngspice operating-point warnings are accepted only when the transient completes. No approximate solver or cached result replaces native physics.

`PipelineResult` exposes:

- `circuitJson`: original input records, preserved without schema normalization.
- `simulationResultCircuitJson`: input records with fresh transient graphs bound to probe IDs; reruns replace graphs for the executed experiments and preserve unrelated results. Circuit JSON timestamps use milliseconds.
- `geometry` and `matrices`: full extracted geometry, R/L/C in ohms/H/F, primitive matrices, checks and unit conversions.
- `experiments`: plan, probes, converter assembly, `waveform: { timeUnit: 's', voltageUnit: 'V', rows }`, and eyes with folded sample rows, metrics and optional DDR assessments. Waveform columns are bound by each probe's `column`; eye rows are `[window, folded_time_s, time_s, voltage_v]`.
- `modeling`, `limitations` and `files`: modeling inputs, explicit scope limits, and in-memory input decks, raw solver outputs/logs, JSON and CSV artifacts.

`generateReport(result)` synchronously returns HTML and CSV strings. The self-contained HTML keeps the full adaptive waveform samples and interactive controls, and uses no network assets. Its browser client is bundled at build time. Neither report generation nor package import reads the source tree.

The Eye view defaults to color density, with a Traces option for individual overlays. Each complete two-UI trace contributes at most one hit per time/voltage bin, so adaptive sample concentration does not bias the colors. Overlaid runs pool their hits and are labeled accordingly. The logarithmic colors show observed occupancy; they do not estimate BER or add noise/jitter.

The plot, Results table and `eye-summary.csv` report actual samples in the eye gate, verified complete windows and the largest recorded timestamp gap. `eyeSampling(rows, eye)` exposes the same counts; `eyeDensity(rows, column, eye, {width, height, yMin, yMax})` returns trace-hit bins for custom renderers. Display interpolation never adds solver samples. Counts alone do not establish timestep convergence or statistical coverage.

## Explicit Node adapter

Node 22+ applications can opt into filesystem access and native execution:

```ts
import { runPipeline } from '@tscircuit/pcb-spice-pipeline'
import {
  createNativeSolver, loadIbisSources, writePipelineOutput,
} from '@tscircuit/pcb-spice-pipeline/node'

const ibisSources = await loadIbisSources({ circuitJson, baseDir: projectDirectory })
const runSolver = createNativeSolver({
  tools: { fasthenry: '/tools/fasthenry', fastercap: '/tools/FasterCap', ngspice: '/tools/ngspice' },
  timeoutMs: 900_000,
})
const result = await runPipeline({ circuitJson, modeling, ibisSources, runSolver })
await writePipelineOutput({ result, outputDir: 'runs/example' })
```

Tools default to `fasthenry`, `FasterCap` and `ngspice` on PATH. The adapter executes only requests you pass it, in temporary directories cleaned up on success or failure. It captures stdout/stderr and requested outputs, rejects unsuccessful exits/timeouts, and does no setup, downloads or build-receipt enforcement. `loadIbisSources` loads local files only and rejects traversal and symlinks outside `baseDir`. `writePipelineOutput` writes the supplied artifacts plus `generateReport(result)`; existing files with the same names are overwritten.

The previous standalone CLI, entry loader, automatic model downloads, setup command and duplicate legacy pipeline have been removed. CLI integrations should render Circuit JSON with their normal renderer and explicitly supply the adapter. Historical receipt comparison/native-IBIS helpers remain internal under `src/legacy`; the independent audit scripts read historical receipt formats and are not a current library API.

## TSX bridge

The root import does not load React or the core renderer. `/tsx` exports both supported bridge functions:

```tsx
import { ImportedBoard, serializeSimulation } from '@tscircuit/pcb-spice-pipeline/tsx'

circuit.add(<ImportedBoard circuitJson={savedBoard} fabricatorPreset="jlcpcb_standard">
  {/* Native IBIS models, experiments, stimuli, probes and eyes */}
</ImportedBoard>)
await circuit.renderUntilSettled()
const circuitJson = serializeSimulation(circuit)
```

React, `@tscircuit/core` and `@tscircuit/props` are optional peers required by this integration, with development dependencies for bridge tests. Serialization preserves exact saved physical records and IDs, remaps native declarations to them, and rejects ambiguous bindings or added physical children. Saved construction is retained. Generating a stackup from a fabricator preset requires a core build containing merged [core #4826](https://github.com/tscircuit/core/pull/4826); a saved Circuit JSON stackup works with the committed core baseline.

## Modeling and limits

Modeling selects physical lanes, construction, extraction tolerances, explicit source rails and passives. Circuit JSON owns IBIS models, pin states, digital traffic, PCB-engine experiments, probes and eyes. Routed copper derives heights, dielectric thickness/permittivity and conductivity from the saved `pcb_stackup`. Straightened-stage modeling remains an explicit reduction with documented approximations.

`modeling.ddrAssessments` optionally binds a ground-referenced DQ probe/eye to a differential received DQS probe. Each configuration supplies its direction, sample offset, Vref, AC/DC thresholds, setup/hold times, minimum strobe amplitude and maximum interval error. Received DQS crossings center complete two-UI windows. Assessments retain configured limits, per-edge margins and unevaluated checks; uncharacterized limits are illustrative. Finite simulated observations do not establish DDR compliance, BER or hardware accuracy.

The historical saved AM3352 routed DDR case remains a separate FastHenry numerical failure. Successful synthetic strip/matrix tests do not resolve it. Existing locally prepared native tools may include historical source patches; this library makes no claim of unmodified physics provenance.

## Build and distribution

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:package
npm pack
```

Packages have scoped ESM `main`, `types` and exports pointing to compiled `dist`. `npm pack` runs the explicit build and includes compiled JavaScript/declarations, README and license. Prepared tarballs install with lifecycle scripts disabled and require no TypeScript source runtime. There is no `prepare`, `install` or `postinstall` script and no install-time solver action. Until publication, consumers should pin an immutable prepared tarball/archive; a Git source checkout must be built and packed explicitly. No npm publication is performed by these scripts.

The build bundles the pure entry with browser dependency resolution, pruning unused converter archive/worker support and fixing polygon-clipping's limits to its upstream browser defaults rather than consulting the host environment.

`pnpm test:package` checks an isolated npm install with no optional peers, root and `/node` imports, a complete in-memory run in Node and Bun when available, guarded host access, and NodeNext declarations. `BUN=/path/to/bun` selects Bun explicitly. Unit fixtures use canned solver responses to test orchestration; native regressions use real processes:

```sh
PCB_SPICE_FASTHENRY=/tools/fasthenry \
PCB_SPICE_FASTERCAP=/tools/FasterCap \
PCB_SPICE_NGSPICE=/tools/ngspice pnpm test:native
```

The native suite executes the full R + jωL/Maxwell-C regression and a complete real extraction/refinement/transient. Set `PCB_SPICE_TEST_MODEL_DIR` to a project root containing the exact `models/` files from `examples/vendor-models.lock.json` to additionally exercise the vendor examples. The suite never downloads those assets or builds native tools.
