/**
 * simulation — experiments as declared on the board, and running them in ngspice.
 * Owns: SimulationPlan declaration from simulation_* records (timing, probes, stimuli, pin
 * states), electrical node mapping + ideal sources/passives, the converter run
 * definition per model, probe-scope validation, the experiment netlist, ngspice diagnostics,
 * waveform coverage checks, and simulation_transient_voltage_graph result records.
 * Order (today's runPipeline): generalDeclarations -> electricalSources -> safeSimulationPlans
 * -> [buffers compile with modelRunDefinition] -> bindExperiments -> [extraction] -> runExperiment per plan.
 * Artifacts: electrical-node-map.json, experiments/<id>/{experiment.json, <model>.lib, simulation.cir,
 * ngspice.*, waveform.dat, waveform.csv, waveform.json}.
 * Imports: kernel, solver, board, extraction, observation, buffers (types).
 * (Was: declarations.ts, general-spice.ts, stimulus.ts, ngspice part of general-pipeline.ts.)
