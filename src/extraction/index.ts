/**
 * extraction — what the channel is electrically.
 * Owns: meshing (ground mesh, copper surface triangulation, panel sizing), FastHenry/FasterCap
 * decks from board's Geometry, native-output parsing and log scans, coarse/refined convergence,
 * reciprocity/passivity/DC-R/capacitance-sign/energy checks, the linear algebra those need, and the
 * RLGC subcircuit text (channel.cir).
 * Artifacts: today's stage-N/** (decks, solver logs/requests/outputs, extraction.json) and channel.cir.
 * Imports: kernel, solver, board. (Was: extraction.ts, matrices.mjs, deck halves of
 * geometry.ts/copper.ts, spice.ts channelSpice.)
