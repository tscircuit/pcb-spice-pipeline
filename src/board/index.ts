/**
 * board — everything known about the physical board, read from Circuit JSON.
 * Owns: Circuit JSON admission (zod record schemas, subcircuit scope), stackup, port selection,
 * lane -> route resolution, and channel geometry for BOTH reductions (straightened stages +
 * stackup-derived returns; routed copper as UNMESHED mm polygons/paths). Never writes a deck:
 * meshing and decks are extraction's (they depend on ExtractionSettings and refinement).
 * Artifacts: inputs/circuit.json, geometry.json (today's `Geometry` bytes).
 * Imports: kernel. (Was: schema.ts, circuit-schema.mjs, stackup.ts, subcircuit-scope.ts,
 * geometry.ts minus decks, copper.ts minus meshing/decks, stage-returns.ts.)
