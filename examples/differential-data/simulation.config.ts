  description: "Designed SN65HVD72 RS-485 pad/channel board, 250 kbps explicit data",
  modelingNotes: [
    "Native top signal traces include bends; extraction preserves total length/width and straightens them into parallel strips with 6-mm center spacing.",
    "Finite bottom return strip uses the stated 0.35-mm ground-route width, bottom copper separation and y=-6-mm main segment. Ground escape bends, vias and excess length are omitted.",
    "Homogeneous epsilon_r=4.1 is an explicit FR-4 assumption; air fields, dielectric loss, neighboring copper and package coupling are outside this reduction.",
    "120-ohm RTERM is a real routed TSX resistor at the receiver, included by declared passive scope. This is one terminated point-to-point experiment, not an RS-485 compliance or receiver-logic test.",
